    description: 'A dapper gentleman with impeccable taste in berries and spectacles.',
    size: '30 × 40 cm',
    medium: 'Handmade watercolour on 300gsm cold-pressed cotton paper',
    story: 'Sir Reginald Fox wakes each morning at precisely half-past six, adjusts his tiny gold spectacles, and inspects the berry bushes in his walled garden before anyone else in the village stirs. He once held the position of Head Librarian at the Meadowshire Reading Room, but retired early to pursue his true passion: cataloguing every variety of wild berry found within a five-mile radius of his cottage. On Thursdays he hosts "Tea & Taxonomy" in his parlour, where guests are treated to elderflower scones and impassioned lectures on the difference between a boysenberry and a marionberry. Despite his scholarly demeanour, Sir Reginald is known for his booming laugh and his habit of humming half-remembered folk songs while he paints.',

    description: 'Found nestled in a porcelain teacup surrounded by wildflowers.',
    size: '25 × 35 cm',
    medium: 'Handmade watercolour on 300gsm cold-pressed cotton paper',
    story: 'Miss Beatrice Bunny was discovered as a tiny kit, fast asleep inside a forget-me-not-blue teacup at the Bramblewood Flea Market. The stall-keeper, a kindly dormouse called Mrs Finch, wrapped her in a handkerchief and carried her home. Beatrice grew up surrounded by wildflowers and porcelain, and to this day she cannot pass a charity shop without checking every cup and saucer for sleeping creatures. She runs a small flower-arranging studio from her burrow and supplies posies to every wedding in the county. Her signature touch is always a sprig of chamomile — "for calm nerves and kind hearts," she says with a gentle twitch of her nose.',

    description: 'A peculiar scholar with a fondness for the unconventional.',
    size: '30 × 40 cm',
    medium: 'Handmade watercolour on 300gsm cold-pressed cotton paper',
    story: 'Professor Hoots holds three doctorates — in Marine Philosophy, Ambient Botany, and the History of Puddles — none of which are recognised by any major university, a fact that does not trouble him in the slightest. He lives in a converted greenhouse on the edge of Fernwick Pond, surrounded by terrariums, leaning towers of books, and at least one unidentified moss he is convinced will "change everything." His lectures, delivered to an audience of patient newts and the occasional passing heron, are legendary for their tangents. Students adore him because he begins every class by asking, "What wonderful nonsense shall we discover today?"',

    description: 'A seasoned traveller with stories from every coastline.',
    size: '35 × 45 cm',
    medium: 'Handmade watercolour on 300gsm cold-pressed cotton paper',
    story: 'Captain Barnaby Bear spent thirty years sailing a small wooden ketch named The Elderberry along every coastline he could find on a map — and several he couldn\'t. He has weathered storms off Cape Fern, traded sea-glass with harbour cats in Port Clover, and once navigated entirely by the scent of fresh bread drifting from a seaside bakery. Now retired to a cliffside cottage, he spends his days whittling miniature boats, writing letters to old friends in distant ports, and telling greatly exaggerated tales to any creature who will listen. His favourite saying: "The sea teaches you patience; the shore teaches you gratitude."',

    description: 'Grace and poise, with a crown of wildflowers.',
    size: '30 × 40 cm',
    medium: 'Handmade watercolour on 300gsm cold-pressed cotton paper',
    story: 'Lady Rosalind Deer moves through the world as though every meadow is a ballroom and every breeze a waltz. She inherited Fawnley Manor — a crumbling but beautiful estate wrapped in ivy and hollyhocks — and has turned its overgrown grounds into the most enchanting wildflower garden in the county. Each spring she hosts the Fawnley Flower Crown Festival, where creatures of all kinds come to weave circlets of daisies, cornflowers, and sweet peas. Rosalind herself wears a fresh crown every single day, even to the grocer\'s. She believes flowers have a language of their own, and she is fluent.',

    description: 'The neighbourhood physician, known for gentle paws and wise counsel.',
    size: '25 × 35 cm',
    medium: 'Handmade watercolour on 300gsm cold-pressed cotton paper',
    story: 'Dr Whiskers has been the village physician of Little Fernsby for as long as anyone can remember. His surgery sits above the bakery (which he says is "excellent for morale"), and his waiting room is furnished with squashy armchairs, a crackling fireplace, and a bowl of butterscotch sweets that never seems to empty. He prescribes long walks, warm soup, and "at least one good laugh a day" far more often than he prescribes medicine. Patients leave feeling better before he\'s even examined them. In the evenings, he sits in his window seat with a cup of chamomile tea, watching the lamplighter make his rounds, and purring softly to himself.',

    description: 'A cheerful soul most at home by the riverbank.',
    size: '25 × 35 cm',
    medium: 'Handmade watercolour on 300gsm cold-pressed cotton paper',
    story: 'Mr Puddles earned his name on account of never, ever walking around a puddle when he could splash directly through it — a habit he has maintained well into adulthood with zero regret. He lives in a snug holt tucked beneath the roots of a grand old willow tree on the banks of the River Thistlebrook. Every morning he swims three laps of Otter\'s Bend "to get the wiggles out," then spends the rest of the day building elaborate stone towers on the riverbank, fishing for his lunch, and waving at passing boats. He is the self-appointed organiser of the annual Thistlebrook Raft Race, which he has won fourteen years running — though no one else seems to mind.',

    description: 'Holds court with dignity and an impressive hat collection.',
    size: '30 × 40 cm',
    medium: 'Handmade watercolour on 300gsm cold-pressed cotton paper',
    story: 'Duchess Penelope Badger presides over Blackthorn Sett with a quiet authority that comes not from title but from being the sort of creature everyone instinctively trusts. Her hat collection — numbering two hundred and thirty-seven at last count — is displayed in a purpose-built gallery beneath the sett, each hat resting on its own velvet stand with a small brass plaque noting the occasion on which it was worn. She attends every village event, judges every baking competition with firm but fair paws, and writes a weekly advice column in the Fernsby Gazette under the pen name "Auntie Stripe." Her counsel is always the same: "Stand tall, be kind, and never underestimate a good hat."',

    description: 'Golden light filtering through the morning mist.',
    size: '35 × 50 cm',
    medium: 'Handmade watercolour on 300gsm cold-pressed cotton paper',
    story: 'This scene was captured on a still October morning, just after dawn, when the meadow behind Clover Hill was draped in a thin veil of golden mist. The artist set up her easel while the dew was still heavy on the grass, working quickly to catch the way the first sunlight turned every droplet into a tiny lantern. A robin perched on a nearby fence post and sang through the entire sitting, as if providing the soundtrack. The painting carries the particular hush of those early hours when the world is caught between sleep and waking, and everything feels soft, unhurried, and full of quiet promise.',

    description: 'A quiet corner of the forest, painted in soft greens.',
    size: '30 × 40 cm',
    medium: 'Handmade watercolour on 300gsm cold-pressed cotton paper',
    story: 'Deep in the Hawthorn Woods, where the path curves and the canopy closes overhead like a cathedral ceiling, there is a moss-covered clearing that the locals call the Thinking Spot. Generations of creatures have come here to sit, breathe, and let the forest do the talking. The light filters down in dappled patches of green and gold, and the only sounds are the creak of branches and the gentle drip of water from leaf to leaf. This painting was made over three visits, each time adding another layer of green until the paper itself seemed to breathe with the quiet life of the woods.',

    description: 'Rolling hills and hedgerows under a watercolour sky.',
    size: '35 × 50 cm',
    medium: 'Handmade watercolour on 300gsm cold-pressed cotton paper',
    story: 'Painted from the top of Buttercup Hill on a breezy afternoon in late May, this piece captures the patchwork of fields, hedgerows, and winding lanes that make up the heart of the Fernshire countryside. A handful of sheep dot the middle distance like cotton bolls, and a single church steeple rises above the treeline in the far valley. The sky was particularly dramatic that day — great billowing clouds that shifted from pearl to lavender over the course of the sitting. The artist says she could hear a cuckoo calling from somewhere in the hedgerow, which she considers extremely good luck for a landscape.',
